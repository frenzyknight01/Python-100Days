If ... Else in One Line
There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short. Here's an example:
'''

a = 3030
b = 303030
print("A") if a>b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

c = 9 if a<b else 0
print(c)
